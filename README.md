# Checklists for IT job seekers: resumes and social profiles

*Aligned with the reality of the IT labor market in 2025.*

As engineers speaking to fellow engineers, our goal isn't just to show you the steps you can do. We'd like to explain WHY certain actions matter when crafting your CV and preparing for a job search.
Below, you'll find a guidance on how to structure your resume and optimize your profiles on career and professional networks such as LinkedIn and GitHub.

By following these simple steps, your profiles and resumes will make a much stronger impression on recruiters and employers. 
To put this insights into practice, fork this repository and create a TODO issue with a predefined list of actions:

## 1. General checklist

General recommendations for resumes and professional network profiles.

It's critical to understand the role of ATS in the job search.
If you never heart about what is ATS, read this [short note](#7-terms)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Contact Information

Ensure all relevant communication channels, including messengers, location details,
and active professional profiles, are listed accurately. Verify that links are
functional and up-to-date. We often hear stories of recruiters finding excellent
candidates but failing to establish contact due to incomplete or inaccurate details.
Providing valid contact information and using your real name boosts credibility.
Be sure to omit unfinished personal websites, as they may detract from your overall
professional impression.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Avatar / Photo

If you're actively seeking employment or open to opportunities, a photo works
better than a creative avatar. Seeing someone fosters trust ‚Äî
a fundamental psychological principle. Note that in some countries,
[laws may prohibit](https://resume.io/blog/picture-on-resume-or-not)
requiring photos on resumes to prevent discrimination.

A strong photo can profoundly affect hiring outcomes, often more than applicants anticipate.
Research shows that simply swapping a single photo can lead to drastically
different responses to a resume.

Criteria for a good photo:

- Face-focused portrait. The percentage of "creativity" should be related to your role in the team.
- Neutral background and attire.
- Adequate quality: clear, well-exposed image.

How to take a quality photo at home:

- [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_rPTWXn__U)
- [Article](https://headshots-inc.com/blog/how-to-take-professional-headshots-at-home/)
- AI photo Enhancer: [ReMini.ai](https://remini.ai) (one photo enhancement for free)
- Paid AI Enhancers: [HeadShotPro](https://www.headshotpro.com/) & [HeadPix.ai](https://headpix.ai/)

For best results, consider a professional photo shoot.

One photo can be reused across various platforms. Opt for light, office-like, or urban backgrounds.
Avoid scenic backdrops like waterfalls, as they might subconsciously irritate viewers
who haven‚Äôt had a vacation in years!

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Full Name

Synchronize how your name appears across LinkedIn, GitHub, and your resume. Recruiters shouldn't
have to guess if different accounts belong to the same person, especially if you've changed your
surname.
Transliteration between profiles should remain consistent.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Title / Specialty / Desired Position

The title (e.g., Product Engineer) on your resume and profiles must align
with the **position you're applying for**.
This field is crucial for talent searches and filtering within [ATS systems](#7-terms).

A common mistake is spending mere minutes on crafting a title, assuming it's self-evident. However,
this field deserves careful consideration. Your title should reflect your desired rather than
current
role/specialization. Use popular, widely recognized job titles. Phrases like "Backend Ninja" may
make
sense to humans but will negatively impact search rankings because text-based searches
prioritize exact matches.
As a result, your resume could go unnoticed.

When working on title, we recommend using a [SEO](#7-terms) approach. Search engine guidelines
for a title typically recommend staying within 50‚Äì80 characters.
The beginning of the line carries the most weight.
Keep in mind that you don't know where your title might get truncated or shortened in an ATS,
so ensure it looks good at varying lengths. We suggest choosing one of these formats:

```
1) [Desired Position Title] | [Narrowing Hard Skill(s)]

EXAMPLES:
Senior Frontend Developer | React.js, Redux, Node.js, Tailwind CSS
Senior Frontend Developer | CSS Animation & Accessibility
```

```
2) [Desired Position Title] | [Value Proposition]

EXAMPLES:
Senior Frontend Developer | Mentoring Teams While Driving Innovation
Senior Frontend Developer | Delivering Pixel-Perfect, Responsive Solutions
```

## 2. Resume checklist

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Contact information. Full name. Photo.

Follow the guidens from the [General checklist](#1-general-checklist) section.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Readability

The resume should be easily readable by a human and parsable by a robot.
Use only PDF format (unless the job requirements specify otherwise).
HTML and other formats will be a problem for ATS.
Use a standard font of an adequate size (more below). The resume should look clean and readable.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Structure

The resume has a standard structure from which it is better not to deviate:

- Headline, the desired position
- Photo (not always, see above)
- Full name
- Current location: country/city
- Contacts. Links to profiles in professional networks (GitHub, GitLab, StackOverflow) ‚Äì desirable
- Brief description / summary
- Technical stack, up to 7 main technologies
- Work experience
- Work permits ‚Äì depending on the situation
- Readiness for relocation ‚Äì optional
- Knowledge of languages ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äì depending on the situation
- List of main hard and soft skills
- Education

It is not recommended to exceed 1-2 pages for juniors and 2-3 pages for senior specialists. If it
does not fit,
try reducing the font size, for example, to 10-12 points. If it still does not fit, you need to cut
out the excess.

_Corrections for students._
Instead of `Work experience ‚Üí Education`, change the structure to `Education ‚Üí Projects`.
For non-students, a list of projects is also acceptable, in certain cases.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Other

It is worth checking the resume with a PDF validator. The text should be proofread several times,
it should not contain spelling errors. Knowledge of the language may be secondary... but errors
indicate problems with attention to detail, a valuable skill. Ask a colleague or friend to check
your resume ‚Äî this is always useful. Use spell check services.

via [issues](https://github.com/devscanr/resume-checklist/issues)*.

## Common CV Mistakes

- Age is indicated.
- Emoji are used in the text. Acceptable in certain cases.
- CV in WORD or HTML format. See above.
- Links like "Find out more here". ATS do not follow links.
- Requirements for the presence/absence of photos are not met.
- Copy protection is enabled in PDF (may interfere with ATS).
- No headings. Creative headings or phrases.
- Politics, religion, hobbies - anything that is not related to the job.
- Too much information.

List your hobbies and interests in LinkedIn, GitHub. There should be no room for this in the CV.

## 3. Resume under a microscope üî¨

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Summary / About me

A short, concise description of your experience, key skills, and achievements.
It presents you as a specialist. Explains why extactly you should be hired.
Maximum 3-4 sentences. For everything else, there are sections "Responsibilities" and "Achievements"
at each place of work. You can write in the 3rd person (adds neutrality)
or in the 1st person (adds individuality).
This point may be regulated by law or company rules, double-check.
On LinkedIn, it is better to write in the 1st person.

What can/should be indicated:

- Your general expertise, transferable skills.
- Your strengths.
- Skills in demand for the desired position.
- Your preferences regarding the industry, company, team, project (of course, not all at once).

[Examples for reference](https://resume.supply/examples/software-engineer-objectives-summaries).
The text from the summary is used for cover letters (with modifications).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Work experience

Indicate the names of companies, dates of work and positions. Up to the last three that are relevant
to your desired job.
Descriptions should be adequate to the position you are applying for and the level of expertise.
Stick to the format `developed > details > effect`. Focus on results and achievements, not the
process.
But without exaggeration. A junior developer who "increased the company's revenue by 50%" will be
perceived as ü§°.

In the description of tasks and achievements, use active voice and past tense (increased, created,
implemented).
The years and months of work should be indicated. Specify the skills that were used in this
position.
For the last place, you can even indicate a contact person for communication (maximizing trust).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Education

List the primary educational institutions and courses that are directly
relevant to the desired position. Keep only those entries that align with your target role
(students may include relevant projects). Limit to three points.
Format should visually resemble the _Work Experience_ section.
You can mention ongoing education with a corresponding note.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Skills

Include only skills that directly match the desired position. Interesting hobbies unrelated to the
field can detract from the resume rather than enhance it. Remember, the resume is a formal document
showcasing your professional capabilities. Focus on listing your core technical stack. Extensive
lists of every framework and library appear unprofessional and do not benefit even a junior-level
candidate.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Font

Select a standard font that is compatible with ATS. Ensure the font size falls within 
an acceptable range of 10-16px. For resumes in the IT sector, consider opting for sans-serif fonts, 
as they tend to appear neater and more modern.

Recommended sans serif fonts:
- Arial (maximum readability, neutral, technological)
- Calibri (more user-friendly, readable in small sizes)
- Trebuchet (even more user-friendly, informal)

Recommended serif fonts. For headings or body text, if you want to look formal/conservative:
- Cambria (formal, modern)
- Georgia (slightly more decorative)

Recommended monospace fonts. Optional for technology list:
- Courier

When using multiple fonts, ensure they complement each other visually, but this is a nuanced matter. 
Essentially, the letter widths should align as much as possible when overlaid at the same visual size. 
If you aim to achieve this, try utilizing a 
[font comparison service](http://www.identifont.com/differences?first=Trebuchet&second=Calibri) for assistance.

Most applicants are better off sticking to 1 font and creating hierarchy solely by size and weight
(boldness) of the font.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ How many resumes to create

Create one basic resume that reflects your experience and key competencies. Then, if you are
applying for several similar positions or the industry has established different terms for the same
thing, create
1-2 resume variations with adjustments and accents. Don't spread yourself too thin - one good resume
works better than several mediocre ones. Your resume will be compared with your public profiles.
If recruiters find contradictions, you have done yourself a disservice by following the
recommendations to create a "unique resume for each vacancy."

## 4. LinkedIn profile checklist

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Contact information. Full name. Photo

Follow the recommendations from the [General checklist](#1-general-checklist) section.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Title, desired position

Follow the recommendations from the [General checklist](#1-general-checklist) section.

LinkedIn has a special block
for listing "Job Titles" options, which can be opened by the blue "Open To" button in the page
header.

We would like to emphasize once again that for recruiters, when they are looking for talent,
your job title is the most important information.
It is recommended to list all common synonyms for the roles by which you would like to be found.
For example: Security Researcher and Malware Analyst can solve identical tasks, but the search will
indicate only one of them.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ About yourself (main text), Skills

Follow the recommendations from the [Resume under a microscope](#3-resume-under-a-microscope) section.

A LinkedIn description can be longer and more personalized than a resume. The latter is a dry
description
of you as an employee, as a specialist. Your social profiles, however, can (and should)
add a note of personality and character.

When choosing profile skills and skills related to experience at a specific company, make sure that
the most important skills are listed first. LinkedIn collapses information and can give a false
impression of your competencies if they are not sorted correctly.
In addition, the first skills will naturally collect more reactions (endorsements) than the last.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Work experience, Education

Follow the recommendations from the section [Resume under a microscope](#3-resume-under-a-microscope).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Custom URL

Activate a custom URL with your name: `linkedin.com/in/yourname`. Looks more professional.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Recommendations

In today's competitive talent market, profiles without reviews look increasingly pale.
There is nothing difficult in exchanging reviews
with former colleagues. Accordingly, their absence means that you 1) do not get along with
colleagues,
or 2) do not show initiative, or 3) think that "this will do".
Would you personally hire a person with such characteristics?

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ "Open to work" flag

Turn on the "Open to work" status. This is a flag that will add your profile to the lists for
recruiters.
Some recruiters have mixed feelings about the green "Open to Work" sign.
The opinion, which we personally do not share, is that this sign is added "out of desperation".

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Other achievements

Certificates, awards, courses, publications increase trust and indicate "above average" expertise.
All other things being equal, an employer will always prefer a person
with such evidence of competence to another candidate. In addition, all these achievements speak
of you as a "Continuous Learning" expert, and this skill is consistently included in the TOP-5 most
in-demand cross-job skills.

## 5. GitHub profile checklist

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Contact information. Full name. Avatar

Follow the recommendations in the [General checklist](#1-general-checklist) section.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Brief description (bio)

Follow the recommendations in the [Resume under a microscope](#3-resume-under-a-microscope) section. 

This field can hold an even shorter summary of your resume or outline your professional goals. 
Since the profile isn‚Äôt as formal as a resume/CV, there aren‚Äôt strict guidelines here. Still, 
we advise including your title for added clarity.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Repositories

Select and pin 3 key repositories at the top of the page. If everything is weak, it is better not to
pin anything.
Add a description to each valuable repository (what kind of project, why it was created, tags).
Do not be among those who did everything that was necessary, but could not or did not want to
present their work.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Stars

Set stars to your favorite/interesting technologies, if you haven't already. For active accounts,
the lack of stars suggests that you 1) aren't interested in anything, or 2) don't appreciate other
people's work,
or 3) are super busy and bogged down in business. If you have a lot of stars, organize them into
lists (optional).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Followees

Follow leaders in your areas of interest. The lack of followees is perceived in the same way as
the lack of stars.
Having a lot of followers is not necessary (and it is harder to change). We recommend exchanging
mutual following with friends to get rid of zeros.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Organizations

Follow organizations in your areas of interest. GitHub organizations are clubs or companies.
Tracking organizations, repositories shows your interests. According to our research and experience 
in hiring, the more the recruiter and employer know about you, the better.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ README

If you are motivated and have an above average GitHub profile, we recommend adding
[a README profile](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).
Follows LinkedIn's profile design rules, see the [corresponding checklist](#4-linkedin-profile-checklist).

## 7. Terms

**ATS** (Applicant Tracking System) is software used by recruiters when working with candidates.
Your data gets stored in this system when you submit applications or when recruiters discover your
public profiles.
In situations where the volume of resumes outweighs available jobs (which happens frequently),
recruiters implement stringent filters to streamline their workflow.
As a result, only a fraction of applicants are reviewed by actual recruiters.
If your resume can't be parsed or fails to meet filter criteria, it‚Äôs automatically archived.
[Read more about ATS here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/guide-formatting-your-resume-atshr-ai-systems-alexander-hinojosa/).

**SEO** (Search Engine Optimization) is about helping search engines understand sites' content,
and as result helping users find releval information.
